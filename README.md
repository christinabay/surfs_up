## 1. Overview of Analysis
With the objective of opening a surf shop, investor W. Avy has asked for an analysis of weather data in Oahu, where the shop will be located. The weather anaylsis will look at the temperature and precipitation in the area. It's assumed that rain and cold weather will negatively affect sales - so we're looking for a location with low rainfall and warm temperatures.
